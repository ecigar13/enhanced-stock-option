This uses the API of TradeKings. TradeKings is then bought by Ally bank, thus the name change.

***
This uses Node.js to stream data and get data from Ally's API. I am not working much on this recently because calculating the option is more on the client's side and does not have to depend on IO speed and Node.js is not designed for that. It also makes synchronous operation more difficult and tend to end up in callback hell.

I still need to learn promise and await/async.

Module required: OAuth (use OAuth 1.0a)
